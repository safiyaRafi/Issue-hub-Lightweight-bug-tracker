## REMOVED: backend Dockerfile
##
## Per project owner's request, Docker-based Render deployment artifacts were removed.
## If you need to deploy the backend as a container (Vercel/Render), recreate a Dockerfile
## suitable for your chosen platform. For now this file serves as a placeholder and can
## be deleted from the repo.

FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
# placeholder to avoid build errors if referenced
